This is a Django-based web app I built to explore Playwright automation while incorporating some fun Mars-related data. 🚀

Features:
🌌 Mars Weather Dashboard – Displays the latest weather on Mars, fetched manually from REMS API (http://cab.inta-csic.es/rems/wp-content/plugins/marsweather-widget/api.php).
📈 Temperature Graphs – Uses matplotlib to visualize min, max, and avg temperatures.
📝 Basic Blog System – Users can authenticate, compose posts, and attach a random Mars rover image to their entries.
🧪 Automated Testing – pytest + playwright tests, with reports generated via pytest-cov and pytest-html.
🔄 CI/CD Integration – Configured with CircleCI for automated testing and deployment.
🚀 Live Deployment – Hosted on PythonAnywhere (currently inactive due to becoming too large for free tier).

This project was primarily a learning exercise for Playwright, but it also brings some cool Mars insights to life! 🌍🔄🔴
